An apple is a red crunchy fruit
Pears are also a delicious fruit but they are yellow
Carrots are a vegetable but they are orange and crunchy
Fall leaves in New England are red yellow and orange
The fall leaves are also very crunchy and fun to step on
Fall in New England is probably my favorite season with apple cider donuts
